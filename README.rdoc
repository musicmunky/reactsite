== README

Initially begun as a way for me to learn ReactJS, now I'm building a page to hold and lookup data for players on the PGA tour.

* Rails 4.x
* MySQL 5.x
* jQuery 1.12.x
* Some flavor of linux
* Apache...or whatever...
* Latest version of ReactJS
* Page for raw PGA data: http://www.pgatour.com/data/players/
* You'll need to create new database.yml and secrets.yml files, as I haven't committed those for obvious reasons
